                <p>As an award-winning CEO disrupting traditional norms and an Insurance trailblazer turned ESG advocate, I bring an unexpected lens to unlocking sustainable progress in Africa’s future. My career has traversed demanding roles from Big4 consultant to brokerage founder yet I chart my own course to stay grounded in my higher purpose – empowering emerging voices to drive change. I believe the world’s most complex challenges require leaders who can hold courageous vision while lifting diverse talents around them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My passion for inclusive leadership led me to launch pioneering initiatives like Women Leadership in Insurance Africa, shaping an industry I’d built expertise in. As Vice Treasurer for the Insurance Brokers Association of Ghana, I’m now influencing national and continent-wide transformation from within key networks. I also sit on multiple boards advising youth skills programs, sustainability ventures, and women-owned businesses to scale their reach.  I consider visible young African role models crucial to shifting narratives so I share lessons from my story.</p>

            <p>I speak on investing in women leaders for prominent global organizations but my core investment lies in mentoring youth one-on-one to unlock their purpose and capabilities. While my career charts ever-bigger visions, I find grounding in simple Everyday moments that renew my sense of possibility – and my commitment to speak hope into people so they can create the change our world needs.</p>

            <p>I may be known as an award-winning executive but I’m still that audacious girl who set her ambitions beyond society’s scripts. Today I stand on stages from Angaza Forum and conferences to Youth camps because I believe YOUR story holds power too. Let’s shift narratives by daring to dream differently – join me in making space for new voices to lead. Progress lies in who we lift up together.</p>
