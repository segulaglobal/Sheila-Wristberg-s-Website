Welcome to my blog! Today, I want to talk about my passion for building leaders for Africa's future. As someone who is interested in various areas such as Women's leadership and empowerment, Leadership, Young people, ESG, and Africa as a whole, I believe that building leaders is crucial for the continent's growth and development.

My main goal is to build leaders who not only think about the present but also the future. This is why I am interested in ESG. I believe that by focusing on environmental, social, and governance issues, we can create a sustainable future for Africa. I also believe in transforming and building Africans to make a difference. Often, young people wait for their turn to act, thinking that now is not the right time.

However, I think that we should change the narrative of leadership. Leadership should not be about experience, but it should start with who you are. You are a leader before the role even comes. I want to build leaders who have the passion to make a difference and are not always thinking about money.

I believe that we should encourage young people to act and not wait until they are old. As the Bible says, "Let no one despise you for your youth" (1 Timothy 4:12). Many Africans are despised because of their youth, and they do not act until they are older. In conclusion, building leaders for Africa's future is crucial for the continent's growth and development. By focusing on ESG and encouraging young people to act, we can create a sustainable future for Africa. Remember, you are a leader before the role even comes.
