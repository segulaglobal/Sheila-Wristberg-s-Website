            <div class="text">
                <p>The world today is at a unique crossroad, facing a blend of traditional challenges like poverty and inequality, whilst also grappling with new-age dilemmas like climate change and interesting opportunities like generative AI. The era of one-dimensional leadership is dead. Today’s leader must be multifaceted- that is adept in building a business, well-versed in technology, committed to social justice, whilst embracing sustainability and global-mindedness.
                <br>    
                I am on a mission to build a pipeline of well-rounded leaders who not only focus on the present but also envision and shape the future.</p>
                <p>As an award-winning CEO disrupting traditional norms and an Insurance trailblazer turned ESG advocate, I bring an unexpected lens to unlocking sustainable progress in Africa’s future. My career has traversed demanding roles from Big4 consultant to Pan-African insurance leader yet I chart my own course to stay grounded in my higher purpose – empowering emerging voices to drive change. I believe the world’s most complex challenges require leaders who can hold courageous vision while lifting diverse talents around them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My passion for inclusive leadership led me to launch pioneering initiatives like <a href="wli-africa.org" class="primary-text dark-text">Women Leadership in Insurance Africa</a>, shaping an industry I’d built expertise in. As Vice Treasurer for the Insurance Brokers Association of Ghana, I’m now influencing national and continent-wide transformation from within key networks. I serve on multiple boards, and I consider visible young African role models crucial to shifting narratives so I share lessons from my story.</p>
                <br>
            </div>
            <img src="/assets/about-gp-photo.jpg" alt="At irisk">
            <p>I speak on investing in women leaders for prominent global organizations but my core investment lies in mentoring youth one-on-one to unlock their purpose and capabilities. While my career charts ever-bigger visions, I find grounding in simple everyday moments that renew my sense of possibility – and my commitment to speak hope into people so they can create the change our world needs.</p>

            <p>I may be known as an award-winning executive but I’m still that audacious girl who set her ambitions beyond society’s scripts. Today I stand on stages from Angaza Forum and conferences to Youth camps because I believe YOUR story holds power too. Let’s shift narratives by daring to dream differently – join me in making space for new voices to lead. Progress lies in who we lift up together.</p>
